# Community Connect: A Mock Social Media Platform to Study Online Behavior

Community Connect is a social media platform for conducting controlled experiments of human behavior, created with the goal of facilitating research on data collected through controlled experiments on social networks. The key distinguishing feature of Community Connect is the ability to control the visibility of user posts based on the groups they belong to, allowing careful and controlled investigation into how information propagates through a social network. We release this platform as a resource to the broader community, with the goal of faciliating research on data collected through controlled experiments.

## Features
- Outcomes: Information about likes, reposts, replies and quotes for each post.
- Images: Images can be attached for each post or comment. 
- Conversation Threads: We make available the functionality to follow the conversation threads created by any post through a unique conversation ID.
- Bridge Users: Posts can become available across groups only when a bridge user who belongs to two groups interacts with them.
- Data Abstraction on the basis of groups.
- Emojis
- Notifications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and Installation

Clone the repo locally then install all the dependencies using [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Souravroych/Mock-social-network-master-updated.git
$ cd Mock-social-network-master-updated
$ npm install
```

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  - expressjs [ExpressJS HTTP middleware](https://npmjs.org/package/express)
  - ejs [Embedded JavaScript templates](https://npmjs.org/package/ejs)
- [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)

Before starting, please make sure you have Node and NPM installed. <br>
For installing Node, follow instructions on this link --> [Installing NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) <br><br>

Make sure to install and configure MongoDB on server.

Also make sure to install Install MongoDB Community Edition on your machine.
[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

You can also install mongoDB compass to explore and manage MongoDB data easily
[MongoDB-Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)



You can verify the installation by running following commonds on terminal or cmd
`npm -v`
`node -v`



Doing a `npm install` in the project folder should install all the dependencies and create a folder called `node_modules`. <br>

## Populating the database using the Excel
![](assets/Users_Groups_database.png)
- Users are prepopulated using the excel file referenced above. 
- The name of the User is in column B **"User name"**. 
- The unique ID for each user needs to entered in column C **"user_id"**, this is the id string using which users Sign-up for the very first time to create their profile. 
- Email in column D holds the **email-ids** for every user. 
- **Group** in column E is used to assign the users to their individual groups. (Users who are assigned in multiple groups are **Bridge Users**)

## Changing the .env file
![ENV](assets/env.png)

Before running, we need to add `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` ![S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html), `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` ![AWS_ACCESS_KET] (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/), `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` & `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`

## For Local

Clone the repo locally then install all the dependencies using [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Souravroych/Mock-social-network-master-updated.git
$ cd Mock-social-network-master-updated
$ brew services restart mongodb-community
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## For EC2

- Create your EC2 instance using your Amazon AWS account. [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html)
- Create your S3 container. [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html)
- Install the node.js dependencies in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance.
  - Connect to your Linux instance as ec2-user using SSH
  - npm install downloads a package and it's dependencies. npm install can be run with or without arguments. When run without arguments, npm install downloads  dependencies defined in a package. json file and generates a node_modules folder with the installed modules.
  - Install MongoDB in the EC2 Operating system.
  - Install pm2 (PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks)
  ```bash
  $ npm install pm2 -g
  ```
  - Start the application using
  ```bash
  $ pm2 start index.js
  ```
  (Your app is now daemonized, monitored and kept alive forever)


## Folder Structure 

To start off please note that all third party dependencies are managed through NPM and a package.json file.
NPM is the defualt package management system for javascript programming and it aids in package installation, dependency management and version management.

`/model` contains all the ORM or the Virtual object database (specifically called schemas in mongoose). <br />
`/views` contains all the view templates (we have used Embedded javascript templating engine for node.js). <br />
`/style` contains all the style sheets or the css files used for stylisation including colour, layout and fonts. <br />
`/routes` contains all the server side functions for different modules or areas of the application. <br />
`/middleware` contains the functions which have access to request object, response object and the next function in applications request response cycle. <br />
`/controller` contains all the major express routes seprated by major sections.  <br />
`/assets` contains all the images, some client side JS files and style sheets. <br />
